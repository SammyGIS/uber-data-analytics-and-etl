# Uber Data Analytics | Data Engineering on GCP & Mage.AI Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to conduct comprehensive data analytics on Uber data using a robust stack of tools and technologies, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio.

## Architecture 
The architecture is designed to seamlessly integrate components for efficient data processing. It involves data ingestion from TLC Trip Record Data into Google Storage, processing with Compute Instances and Mage Data Pipeline Tool, and final storage in BigQuery for further analytics. Looker Studio is then employed for interactive visualization.

## Tools Utilized
1. **Google Cloud Platform**
   - **Google Storage:** Efficiently stores and manages large datasets.
   - **Compute Instance:** Processes and transforms data for analysis.
   - **BigQuery:** A powerful data warehouse for storing and querying massive datasets.
   - **Looker Studio:** Enables interactive exploration and collaboration.

2. **Modern Data Pipeline Tool - Mage.AI**
   - Facilitates seamless data flow and transformation throughout the pipeline.

## Dataset
The TLC Trip Record Data, encompassing yellow and green taxi trip records, serves as the primary dataset. It includes vital information such as pick-up/drop-off details, locations, distances, fares, rate types, payment methods, and passenger counts.
